UrlInspector 🔍

Welcome to UrlInspector – the ultimate URL analysis and inspection tool for developers, security experts, and website administrators. UrlInspector helps you gather vital information about any URL, from HTTP status codes to metadata, links, and page titles.

🚀 What is UrlInspector?

UrlInspector is a powerful Python-based tool that performs a comprehensive analysis of websites and URLs. It provides key information such as:
 • Scan Date: When the URL was inspected.
 • Status Code: HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404, etc.).
 • Headers: All response headers.
 • Title: The <title> of the webpage.
 • Meta: Meta tags, including description and keywords.
 • Links: Extracts all hyperlinks from the page.

🛠️ Functions
